 # LinkedIn

The LinkedIn Clone backend is a scalable microservices-based application built using Spring Boot, designed to replicate core LinkedIn functionalities. It consists of independent services managing authentication, user profiles, company and job postings, and social posts. 

Each microservice handles specific responsibilities, communicating via REST APIs to provide seamless user experiences like user registration, job searching, networking, and posting updates.

Authentication is managed via an active session flag rather than traditional tokens, emphasizing simplicity and session control. This modular architecture enables easy maintenance, scalability, and independent deployment of services.
